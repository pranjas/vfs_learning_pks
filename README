The purpose of this repository to understand the inner workings of Linux VFS
and using hands-on creation of a block device based simple file system. I hope
to demonstrate how to use 

a) Networking within kernel.
b) Pagecache and Buffer heads.
c) Using Journalling via jdb2.

This is going to be a very simple File system mostly to understand the stuff
that goes on underneath. I'll continue to better this as time permits.
